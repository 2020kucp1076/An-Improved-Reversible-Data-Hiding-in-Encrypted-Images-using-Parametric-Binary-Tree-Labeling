1. Encrypt.cpp ->
   Enter the pixel values you want to enter in the normal matrix that represents the image.
   Run the code. You will seee the encrypted image matrix and also the intermediate matrices.
   Now, enter a 3-4 letter string that is the data to hide.
   You will see the marked encrypted image with data embedded.

2. data_hiding.cpp->
   Add this code in the end of encrypt.cpp, and then you will get the embedded matrix.

3. Decrypt.cpp ->
   Enter the pixel values that you got after running the encrypt.cpp file.
   Run the code and you will see the extracted data and decrypted image.
